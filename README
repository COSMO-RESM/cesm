The gh-pages orphan branch of the http://github.com/ESCOMP/cesm repository
holds the sphinx built html files from the master/doc branch.

Releases and development builds should be stored in different subdirectories
and the top-level index.html should be updated with links to the subdirectories
as they are added.
